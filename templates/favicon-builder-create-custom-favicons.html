It is a little graphical picture like a logo that is shown in your program tabs with the site name in bookmarks, and it is likewise noticeable on cell phones and tablets. For the most part, It's a 16X16 and 32X32 pixel picture that can be saved exclusively in ICO and PNG formats depending on the device or browser type. Regardless of size, it also facilitates a visual identifier and strengthens a website's brand recognition and trustworthiness.

                    <p class="lead mb-5">Creating a favicon is not rocket science. You can easily make a professional favicon by just following the simple steps listed below:
                    </p>
                    <ol class="lead">
                        <li><strong>Start with a Clear Image:</strong> Select a simple graphic that visualizes your brand. Make sure to pick a simple design that stands out well in square dimensions and matches your website's color scheme. A complex design can ruin the originality and make it messy.</li>
                        <li><strong>Select a Favicon Builder Tool:</strong> Users can use free or paid versions of favicon builder tools to generate a professional favicon; even newbies can easily use free tools because of their simplicity, such as <a href="https://www.img2img.net/favicon-generator" target="_blank">IMG2IMG</a>, Canva, GIMP, etc.

                        <li><strong>Convert to ICO Format:</strong> ICO is the ideal format for most search engines. If your logo is not in that specific format, you can easily convert it into ICO by using PNG to ICO or Image to ICO converter tools like <a href="https://www.img2img.net/favicon-generator" target="_blank">IMGTOIMG</a>, favicon.io, or RealFaviconGenerator and IMG2IMG.  </li>
                        <li><strong>Add to Your Website:</strong> Place the favicon in your site's root directory and reference it in the HTML header:
                            <pre><code>&lt;link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/favicon.ico"&gt;</code></pre>
                        </li>
